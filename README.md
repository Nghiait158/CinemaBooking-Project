# CinemaBooking-Project
The project's goal is to provide online reservations for movie tickets. Anyone with an internet connection can access the Ticket Reservation System, which is an Internet-based program, from anywhere. The tickets will be reserved via this application. Any internet user may visit the movie theater's website thanks to this online ticket reservation system. In order to book tickets, the user must log in to the system and provide a credit card. Tickets are available for pickup at the counter and One of the finest forms of enjoyment after a busy day is going to the movies with loved ones in theaters. However, all of this excitement fades after spending hours waiting in line to get tickets.The website offers comprehensive facts about all the movies that are presently showing on all the screens, including show times and available seats. Credit card payments are made for ticket reservations, which are refundable if necessary. For individuals who are unable to allocate sufficient time to get their tickets and stand in lengthy lines, our online ticket reservation system is an excellent option. Online ticket booking is available to consumers day or night. Additionally, our reservation system offers the ability to cancel already booked tickets.
